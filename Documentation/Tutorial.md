## Creating a new Knife

### Step 1: Creating Sockets in the StaticMeshEditor

For this first choose a StaticMesh on which you want the SlicingLogic to be.
In this example we use the **SM_Knife_Table**. Double click on it in the
**Content Browser** to open the StaticMeshEditor for it.

In the top bottom should be a tab called **Socket Manager**. Press the button
and add three sockets named **BladeBox**, **Handle** and **CuttingExitpointBox**.
It should look like this: [TutorialPic1](TutorialPictures/1.PNG)
