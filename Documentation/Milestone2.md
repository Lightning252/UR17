# Milestone 2 - deadline 30.03.18

* Pickup and object rotation with menu

# Documentation

* Bug Note: Objects can't be dropped at the moment and if the object was not rotated it won't be picked up in one of the hands.

* For this milestone the HUD was reworked, it works now with code instead of blueprints. There are now two menus, one for the the question if the object should be rotated and one for the pick up in the left or right hand.
