# UR17
Unreal Robots master project repository

# Info

* each branch belongs to a given subproject, e.g. `ur17-p1` belongs to subproject P1
* every branch has the up to date `dev-env` branch from [RobCoG](https://github.com/robcog-iai/RobCoG/tree/dev-env) as default
* every subproject will crate a pull request for each milestone on its corresponding branch
* every pull request should have a `MilestoneX.md` file, in `/Documentation` for every milestone, describing the milestone, what has been done(documentation), how to test the code(working/tested tutorials).
* the pull request (if containing source code) should be contained in a plugin, e.g. `\Plugins\MyPlugin`
* the pull request (if containing new uassets, e.g. meshes, etc.) can be done on the project directly, it should however include the 3D mesh files as well in `.fbx` and `.dae` format in the folder `\Documentation\Meshes`
